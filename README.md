# Cricket-Website

Hi! I'm a beginner learning web development, and Cricket Arena is one of my first projects. Itâ€™s a simple website made using just HTML and CSS.


## Tech Stack

<div align= "left">
<img alt="HTML5" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/html5-%23E34F26.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=html5&logoColor=white"/>
<img alt="CSS3" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/css3-%231572B6.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white"/>
</div>

## Features-

- Navigation bar: Fully styled navigation bar with hover effects, icons, and consistent color scheme. It uses a creative <b>checkbox toggle trick</b> which enables toggling a sidebar without JavaScript.
- Home page: Consists of an animated heading with background image and intro text at the footer.
- Players page: A responsive flexbox of cards for exploring players and teams.
- Gallery page: Built using <b>CSS Grid</b> for a clean and responsive layout with hover effects and spacing handled with pure CSS, showcases iconic cricket moments.
- Quiz Section (Pending): Plan to build a quiz section with using HTML/CSS (JS later) for better user engagement.
